			<p>Before applying for Ph.D., I heard that Rice University is of highest happiness index.
I assured this is the case for undergraduates while not applied to Ph.D. students since environment makes no difference for those living in office (XD).
However today&rsquo;s impromptu visit to the neighbor &ldquo;Hermann Park&rdquo; while I was waiting for the food delivery at nightfall almost changes my mind.</p>

<p>Go out of the school and cross the road to the riverside in the park, I sat on a bench by the river and watched all kinds of people go by, like an old man but not wise enough. Sometime I just appreciate a break from office for observing what&rsquo;s going on in different life stages (e.g., listen to the trivial conversation of a couple).
There must be something magical that I haven&rsquo;t seen before, as in the scientific research of the new paper ideas.
After all, even the combination of the 88 keys in Pinao can be passed down from ancient times to the present and bring forth new vitality.

The other side of the river is an attractive broad vacant grassland, proving a space for people to relax and run and play.
If I had lived here as a child, I would have regarded it as a treasure just as I cannot forget the river in my hometown.
As I walked across the grass, I noticed a new ball game (magic uhh!): two men used poles with little nets to pass the ball to each other, like a baseball bat fused with a glove. But it is too boring to pick up a ball so often for a novice or a bystander like me. So I decide to go straight to the central lake of the park!

</div>
<br>
The lake is rejuvenated by the inflow of running water and many colorful ducks!
Accompanied by the sound of a busker&rsquo;s trumpet, I finished the break and go back office for dinner. It was amazing to find that it only took me one hour while enrich my research life largely.
I suddenly understood the origin of the happiness index thank to the whim for visiting the peaceful neighbor &ldquo;Hermann Park&rdquo;!
