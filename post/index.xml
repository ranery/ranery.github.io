      <description>This post is supposed to be my reflect about cultivating good research taste as an individual researcher, and should always be maintained and reviewed!  
Updates  01/02/2020 Today I find one paper I have criticized got accepted as an oral presentation, I was dismissive at the first glance since one can easily understand how it suppose to work technically and further regarded it as granted. Yet, I ignore its significance and influence for underlying research directions, which is outside of the scope of the algorithm&amp;rsquo;s original analysis.</description>

      <description>Before applying for Ph.D., I heard that Rice University is of highest happiness index. I assured this is the case for undergraduates while not applied to Ph.D. students since environment makes no difference for those living in office (XD). However today&amp;rsquo;s impromptu visit to the neighbor &amp;ldquo;Hermann Park&amp;rdquo; while I was waiting for the food delivery at nightfall almost changes my mind.
Go out of the school and cross the road to the riverside in the park, I sat on a bench by the river and watched all kinds of people go by, like an old man but not wise enough.</description>
