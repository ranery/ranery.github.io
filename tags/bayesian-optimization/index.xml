      <description>Accepted as IEEE TNNLS regular paper! Abstract: Recent techniques built on generative adversarial networks (GANs), such as cycle-consistent GANs, are able to learn mappings among different domains built from unpaired data sets, through min-max optimization games between generators and discriminators.</description>
