      <title>[NeurIPS 2020] ShiftAddNet: A Hardware-Inspired Deep Network </title>

      <description>Accepted as NeurIPS 2020 regular paper! Abstract: Multiplication (e.g., convolution) is arguably a cornerstone of modern deep neural networks (DNNs). However, intensive multiplications cause expensive resource costs that challenge DNN deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, driving several attempts for multiplication-less deep networks.</description>

      <title>[NeurIPS 2020] FracTrain: Fractionally Squeezing Bit Savings Both Temporally and Spatially for Efficient DNN Training </title>
      <link>http://localhost:52834/post/fractrain/</link>

      <description>Accepted as NeurIPS 2020 regular paper! Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in deep neural networks (DNNs) have fueled a tremendous demand for intelligent edge devices featuring on-site learning, while the practical realization of such systems remains a challenge due to the limited resources available at the edge and the required massive training costs for state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNNs.</description>

      <title>[ECCV 2020] HALO: Hardware-Aware Learning to Optimize</title>
      <link>http://localhost:52834/post/l2o/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 18:03:59 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:52834/post/l2o/</guid>
      <description>Accepted as ECCV 2020 regular paper! Abstract: There has been an explosive demand for bringing machine learning (ML) powered intelligence into numerous Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. However, the effectiveness of such intelligent functionality requires in-situ continuous model adaptation for adapting to new data and environments, while the on-device computing and energy resources are usually extremely constrained.</description>
