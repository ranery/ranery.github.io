      <title>[NeurIPS 2020] ShiftAddNet: A Hardware-Inspired Deep Network </title>

      <description>Accepted as NeurIPS 2020 regular paper! Abstract: Multiplication (e.g., convolution) is arguably a cornerstone of modern deep neural networks (DNNs). However, intensive multiplications cause expensive resource costs that challenge DNN deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, driving several attempts for multiplication-less deep networks. This paper presented ShiftAddNet, whose main inspiration is drawn from a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation, that is, multiplication can be instead performed with additions and logical bit-shifts.</description>

      <title>[NeurIPS 2020] FracTrain: Fractionally Squeezing Bit Savings Both Temporally and Spatially for Efficient DNN Training </title>

      <description>Accepted as NeurIPS 2020 regular paper! Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in deep neural networks (DNNs) have fueled a tremendous demand for intelligent edge devices featuring on-site learning, while the practical realization of such systems remains a challenge due to the limited resources available at the edge and the required massive training costs for state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNNs. As reducing precision is one of the most effective knobs for boosting training time/energy efficiency, there has been a growing interest in low-precision DNN training.</description>

      <title>[ECCV 2020] HALO: Hardware-Aware Learning to Optimize</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/publication/l2o/</link>

      <description>Accepted as ECCV 2020 regular paper! Abstract: There has been an explosive demand for bringing machine learning (ML) powered intelligence into numerous Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. However, the effectiveness of such intelligent functionality requires in-situ continuous model adaptation for adapting to new data and environments, while the on-device computing and energy resources are usually extremely constrained. Neither traditional hand-crafted (e.g., SGD, Adagrad, and Adam) nor existing meta optimizers are specifically designed to meet those challenges, as the former requires tedious hyper-parameter tuning while the latter are often costly due to the meta algorithmsâ€™ own overhead.</description>
