      <description>Lottery Ticket Hypothesis  A randomly-initialized, dense neural network contains a subnetwork that is initialized such that—when trained in isolation—it can match the test accuracy of the original network after training for at most the same number of iterations.

      <description>This post is supposed to be my reflect about cultivating good research taste as an individual researcher, and should always be maintained and reviewed!  
Updates  01/02/2020 Today I find one paper I have criticized got accepted as an oral presentation, I was dismissive at the first glance since one can easily understand how it suppose to work technically and further regarded it as granted. Yet, I ignore its significance and influence for underlying research directions, which is outside of the scope of the algorithm&amp;rsquo;s original analysis.</description>

      <description>Before applying for Ph.D., I heard that Rice University is of highest happiness index. I assured this is the case for undergraduates while not applied to Ph.D. students since environment makes no difference for those living in office (XD). However today&amp;rsquo;s impromptu visit to the neighbor &amp;ldquo;Hermann Park&amp;rdquo; while I was waiting for the food delivery at nightfall almost changes my mind.
Go out of the school and cross the road to the riverside in the park, I sat on a bench by the river and watched all kinds of people go by, like an old man but not wise enough.</description>

      <title>[ICLR 2020] Drawing Early-Bird Tickets: Towards More Efficient Training of Neural Networks</title>

      <description>Accepted as spotlight oral paper! Abstract: (Frankle &amp;amp; Carbin, 2019) shows that there exist winning tickets (small but critical subnetworks) for dense, randomly initialized networks, that can be trained alone to achieve comparable accuracies to the latter in a similar number of iterations. However, the identification of these winning tickets still requires the costly train-prune-retrain process, limiting their practical benefits. In this paper, we discover for the first time that the winning tickets can be identified at the very early training stage, which we term as early-bird (EB) tickets, via low-cost training schemes (e.</description>
