      <description>This post is supposed to be my reflect about cultivating good research taste as an individual researcher, and should always be maintained and reviewed!  
Updates  01/02/2020 Today I find one paper I have criticized got accepted as an oral presentation, I was dismissive at the first glance since one can easily understand how it suppose to work technically and further regarded it as granted. Yet, I ignore its significance and influence for underlying research directions, which is outside of the scope of the algorithm&amp;rsquo;s original analysis.</description>

      <description>Accepted as spotlight oral paper! Abstract: (Frankle &amp;amp; Carbin, 2019) shows that there exist winning tickets (small but critical subnetworks) for dense, randomly initialized networks, that can be trained alone to achieve comparable accuracies to the latter in a similar number of iterations. However, the identification of these winning tickets still requires the costly train-prune-retrain process, limiting their practical benefits. In this paper, we discover for the first time that the winning tickets can be identified at the very early training stage, which we term as early-bird (EB) tickets, via low-cost training schemes (e.</description>
